I finally tracked down the last of the idle problems with this car: the air
regulator was bad. It would work fine when I first started the car and the idle
would eventually drop to 800 RPM, but once the car started moving the air
regulator would open back up. A new air regulator fixed the problem. All in all,
here are all the things I did to finally get the car idling right:

 * replaced and reset the TPS
 * cleaned the IACV
 * replaced many rubber hoses with silicone
 * tested the EGR, AIV, and PRVR vacuum lines for leaks
 * replaced the air regulator
