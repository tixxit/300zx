I recently decided to find a project car to work on. Something that would be
fun, but cheap enough that I didn't feel bad about tearing it apart. I decided
to buy an N/A 300zx. Since this is my first project car, I didn't want to shell
out $20k for a TT only to find I didn't have the time to work on the car or
didn't enjoy the process that much. I wanted to buy a running car that didn't
require much body work for under $5k. In a year or 2, if I decide that I'm
having fun and want something faster, I don't mind spending more money on a TT
or LS swap then. On the other hand, if I end up losing interest, I have a
fairly easy exit. Anyways, here it is!

Why the 300zx? I love the car. It's an incredibly good looking car and not just
by 90s standards. It still holds its own today.  I've wanted one since I first
saw one in person, back in high school. It's also one of the cheapest ways to
get one of the iconic Japanese sports/GT cars from the 90s. Also I have a huge
soft spot for Nissans.

I found a Z that mostly hit the things I was looking for. Most important: there
was not much rust and it was under $5k! Rust has been a huge problem with other
Z's I've seen. However, there was quite a bit of bad though:

 * it wouldn't got into 1st gear and sometimes 3rd
 * owner had no idea when timing belt was changed
 * tires were shitty old and bald - need replacement ASAP
 * speedo intermittantly stops working (found this out after purchase)
 * high idle which can be erradic when the throttle is first closed
 * exhaust is falling apart and is way too loud
 * driver seat has a giant rip in it
 * suspension needs a lot of love - the car feels like there is a mattress
   between the car and the road

However, I felt that these were all problems I could tackle!
