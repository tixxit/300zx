Finally got around to buying a compression tester. I also ended up buying a new
battery to do the test, since the one it came with wasn't up to spec for a Z
nor was it healthy. After replacing the battery I started to get at it! After
taking off the balance tube I noticed there was some oil in the intake plenum.
Ugh. A [quick google leads me to believe it may be a clogged PCV
valve](http://forums.nicoclub.com/found-oil-in-the-intake-plenum-any-ideas-t395206.html).
The other option is that the oil is too full. I'm going to do an oil change
anyways, but I'll probably [swap out the PCV valve](https://github.com/tixxit/300zx/issues/8)
just in case.

Another thing I was a bit worried about was that the exhaust's odour was pretty
strong. There was no real colour to it though. A shitty PCV valve leaking oil
into the intake could definitely let through just enough oil to make it smell
without being overbearing. I'm hoping fixing the PCV valve and doing an oil
change will fix this problem too.

The *good news* is that the compression test results were pretty stellar:

| Cylinder | PSI (136-186)| % Max (< 10%) |
|:--------:|-------------:|--------------:|
|     1    |          180 |            4% |
|     2    |          182 |            3% |
|     3    |          185 |            2% |
|     4    |          183 |            3% |
|     5    |          188 |            0% |
|     6    |          182 |            3% |

I'm super happy about this. I was pretty anxious about not doing the test
before purchasing the car, so this was a big relief. I'll probably redo the
test a while after I fix the PCV/oil problem, just to make sure that it isn't
juking the results.
