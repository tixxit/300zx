The car had some minor damage from before I bought it - which included a broken
corner light. The old lights were Nismo clear corners. I'm not a huge fan of
the clear lights, so I bought some used OEM amber (USDM) ones from some dude on
Kijiji. The clear corners actually use a different harness then the USDM ones,
so I had to order some new harnesses as well (*sigh*). On top of this, the
lights I bought had a bunch of red overspray, which I had to sand down/polish.
Anyways, the important bit is that the lights are in.
