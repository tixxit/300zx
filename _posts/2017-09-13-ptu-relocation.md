I relocated the PTU to the nose while doing the timing service.

The v2 PTU always looked like a hack job someone did to the 300zx, rather than
an OEM part, so I was pretty happy to move it out of sight. Additionally, I was
having issues with a shitty connection occasionally causing misfires. I
replaced the sub-harness to fix the shitty connection. Moving it away from the
engine/heat should help avoid future issues with the PTU. Check out my lovely
wiring job here:
