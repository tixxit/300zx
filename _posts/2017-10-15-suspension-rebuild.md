One of the first things I wanted to do with this car was upgrade the
suspension.  Basically, the car drove exactly like you'd think a 30 year old
300zx with mostly original suspension would drive. I also wanted to drop the
car a bit. However, 300zx's are really finicky about drops and even small drops
can easily push the alignment out of spec. So upgrading the suspension is
really an all or nothing proposal.

Some of the steering stuff was covered in another post, but here is the total
list of suspension parts installed/replaced on the car over the last couple of
months:

 - ES steering rack bushings
 - new outer tie rods
 - ES front sway bar bushings
 - rebuilt front LCA (ball joint and ES bushings)
 - Z1 adjustable FUCA (street)
 - SPL adjustable tension rods
 - ES rear sway bar bushings
 - TT sway bar (used)
 - SPL adjustable toe rods
 - SPL adjustable RUCA
 - SPL eccentric lockout kit
 - Tein Flex Z coilovers

This actually covers a lot, but I intentionally decided to punt on the bushing
upgrades for the rear. The plan is to, at some point in the future, drop the
rear subframe and replace all subframe, diff, and rear knuckle bushings in one
shot, preferably with rubber. But that is a lot of work and the bushings in the
rear knuckle and LCA, at least, are in decent enough shape.
