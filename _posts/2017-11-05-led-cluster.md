Fixed 2 things in the gauge cluster:

 * replaced the awful blue LEDs in the gauge cluster and pods with natural white LEDs
 * fixed the intermittent speedo

I actually went for a full set of LEDs for the gauge cluster. The natural
whites are perfect - they basically look like stock 90s Nissan gauge cluster,
but just a bit brighter and more even.

The speedo was a bit of luck too. I wasn't sure what was wrong with it, but
since the odometer kept ticking when the speedo went out, I could assume the
speed sensor was working. My assumption was that it was a loose/old connection,
so I just went wild with a soldering iron on all the old connections on the
back and it seems to have worked!
