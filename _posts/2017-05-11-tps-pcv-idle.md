First, I replaced the TPS and... wow. the TPS made a huge difference in how the
car drives. Before, it felt like it just had no top end. It was OK puttering
around, but but once you laid into it it felt like it just had no more to give.
With the new TPS, the car feels exactly like I thought it should've felt like
from the start. The N/A may not be a fast car, but it isn't slow either. It has
more than enough power to feel great ripping through the gears and put a smile
on my face.

I also went ahead and replaced the PCV valves. For those wondering, the
driver's side PCV valve hose is as much a pain to remove as everyone says it
is. Passenger side PCV valve took 10 minutes total to replace - hose and all.
For the driver's side, it took me an hour to get that stupid hose off - even
after cutting the shit out of it. It took me another 30+ minutes to figure out
a combination of flex joints, extensions and adapters that would work to give
me enough leverage with my ratchet to get the old PCV valve off.

Lastly, I tackled the high idle yet again. In no particular order, I tried the
following:

 * checked the ECU coolant temperature sensor resistance (within spec),
 * cleaned and inspected the throttle bodies (no change),
 * checked the air regulator by pinching hose to balance tube (no change), and
 * cleaned the IACV by spraying a bunch of throttle body cleaner in it.

The last one was the ticket. It got the idle down below 1000. However, it's
still a tad high, even when adjusting the base idle screw down. I'll try
unplugging the AAC to verify whether I've got some remaining vaccuum leaks. If
so, then I have the fun job of finding them.
