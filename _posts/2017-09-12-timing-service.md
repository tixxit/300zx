Finally finished up the 120k timing service. This took longer than expected,
since after finally getting the car back together I realized I had developed an
oil leak.  My suspicion was that it was the front crank seal, since I had
placed the seal in further than I was supposed to, but decided to just carry on
and hope it'd work. Anyways, long story short, my hope was misplaced and I had
to rip down the front of the engine again and replaced the front crank seal.
This time I was careful to keep it flush with the front of the oil pump.
Additionally, I also put some Permatex Ultra Black around the outside of the
seal before installing it. I had marked up the inside of the race a bit and was
worried the leak could also have been coming from there.

Anyways, while I was doing this I also took the timing service, I also caught
up one some other regular maintenance:

 * replaced the spark plugs
 * replaced some of the rubber hoses with silicone ones
 * cleaned & painted the timing covers
 * replaced no-name knock-off underive pulley with a Unorthodox Racing one
 * new accessory belts

For the timing covers, I went with a boring stock (but clean) look:
