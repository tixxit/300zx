So, I had a feeling this was going to end up being a stupid fix but I didn't
think it'd be quite this stupid. One of the 2 bolts - the bottom one - holding
the gear shifter seat to the shifter support was completely missing. When
attempting to to put the car in first or 3rd, the shifter seat would rotate up
with the lever, preventing it from shifting. The top bolt was around where 5th
was, so it'd stay put when going to 5th. A trip to the hardware store and $0.65
later, I replaced the missing bolt and had a functioning shifter again!
Honestly, a quick and easy win feels really great. I'm sure the rest will be
horrible, but glad to start off on a positive note.

I'm a fan of putting on all the bows and whistles, so I also ordered an OEM
replacement shift knob, since the leather on the old one was coming off.
