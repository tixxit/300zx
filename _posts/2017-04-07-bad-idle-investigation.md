Next on the list was the idle. The car idled high (over 1k RPM) and would
sometimes idle erradically when I'd first let off the throttle after
accelerating. I started by checking the TPS first, just to make sure the
electrical bits were working OK and immediately found problems. The idle switch
worked fine, but the position sensor had incorrect voltages. At idle, sometimes
it'd read OK, but other times it'd read low (< 0.4v). I never saw it go above
1V even at WOT. I ordered a new TPS and also went ahead and ordered a bluetooth
consult dongle thing.
