The tires the car came with were junk. They were cracking and bald on the
inside. I put the car up on jack stands and took the wheels off to get some new
rubber on them. I checked the DOT code and found out the existing tires were
made in 2004 - 13 years old! Choices were pretty slim for replacement tires.
The stock wheels on the 300zx are a pretty odd size nowadays. I ended up going
with some Falken Azenis RT-615K tires. They supposedly perform great, but have
a very short life span, which is perfect this car (plan on getting new wheels
in a year or 2).

In the meantime, I decided to take stock of the rust on the car.  I'm just
going to [throw it all into the GitHub issue on it for now](https://github.com/tixxit/300zx/issues/11).
It's not bad, but not perfect either. The short version is that I need to take
the rear bumper cover off sometime this summer and go wild with a grinder,
wheel brush, and a welder. The good news is that the worst of it isn't visible
and hence my shitty fixes won't be visible either.

While the car was up, I also finally got around to doing an oil change. I kinda
went on autopilot here and accidentally put on a filter for my Ford Escape, which
was lying right beside me, rather than the 300zx. I realized my mistake when I
saw the OEM Nissan filter in a box, *after* I had already put oil back in the
car... Anyways, long story short, I ended up having to chuck a gallon of Mobil
1 and an Escape oil filter in the trash (not literally, they're queued up for a
dump run). I think the lesson here is that I need a better organization scheme
for parts than "putting shit in random boxes."

Finally, I decided to tackle a problem that has been bugging me - the tail
lights weren't flush with the car. The lights are still out of the car though,
so I'll cover it in another post once they're back in.
